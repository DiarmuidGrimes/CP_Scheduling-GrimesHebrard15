# CP_Scheduling-GrimesHebrard15
Code used in 2015 paper "Solving Variants of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem Through Conflict-Directed Search" (https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.2014.0625). 
Code using old version of Mistral solver (https://homepages.laas.fr/ehebrard/mistral.html), 
and old version of IBM ILOG CP Optimizer (https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio/cplex-cp-optimizer).

Folder cpojsp contains code used for running IBM ILOG CP Optimizer solver with different scheduling models as discussed in paper,
and similarly folder lw_solver contains code used for running the Mistral solver with different scheduling models.
Note code compatibility with either solver has not been explicitly maintained as of paper publications.
